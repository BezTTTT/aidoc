        <h5 class="card-title text-center">Terms and Conditions</h5>
        <h6 class="card-title text-center" style="color:fuchsia">You must agree to the following terms and conditions before using our system</h6>
        <br>
        <p class="card-text">1. This computer program is called 'Artificial Intelligent System for Detecting and Analyzing PMDs and Oral Cancer'.
            The system is part of a project initiated by the Department of Health to develop an oral public health surveillance system, for 
            screening and evaluating risk factors of precancerous lesions and oral cancer for Thai people. This project receives a budget and is under 
            the supervision of the Intercountry Centre for Oral Health, Department of Health, Ministry of Public Health</p>
        <p class="card-text"><b>2. (Conditions) The system is not a medical device.
            The results cannot be used for diagnosis or medical references in any way.
            If users find any abnormalities or suspect that there are abnormalities in the oral cavity,
            they must seek medical advices and recieve proper diagnosis from a licensed doctor or dentist immediately.</b></p>
        <p class="card-text">3. The system supports only the image data of an oral cavity that are taken with the standard protocol.
            The size of the lesions must be sufficiently large and clear. It must have appropriate and consistent lighting.
            With only these conditions, the AI should be able to provide effective prediction results.
            Users can study how to take an effective oral images in the menu: "Prediction Examples"</p>
        <p class="card-text">4. The AI recognizes only certain lesions including pre-cancerous lesions (Oral Potentially
            Malignant Disorder or OPMD) and oral cancer lesions, type Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (or
            OSCC) only. Processing of other types of oral lesions is not supported.
            Example images showing the characteristics of lesions supported by the system will be displayed in the menu: "Prediction Examples"</p>
        <p class="card-text"><b>5. (Conditions) Even though, the system now opens to the public, it is still in the developmental phase. It is currently in the process of
            researching, collecting more information, and improving the accuracy. It is still considered incomplete and error-prone. The system is presumably expected to give incorrect results any time.
            The system has not yet been rigorously verified for accuracy by relevant agencies or authorities.
            Therefore, the International Center for Dental Public Health and the development team will not be responsible for any damages resulting from use in any case.</b></p>
        <p class="card-text"><b>6. (Conditions) By using the system, users agree to grant permissions and rights to the Intercountry Centre for Oral Health and the responsible government agencies,
            to preserve, modify, and delete the data they submit to the system. We have obligations to disclose user's personal information to the authorized officials when deemed necessary</b></p>
        <p class="card-text">7. Because the system is still on the development phase and not yet complete, it is necessary for us (the research and development team)
            to use the image data shared by the users to continuously train the AI to improve its capability to detect lesions in oral cavities.
            On this occasion, we would like to thank every user, those who continuously submit image data into the system.
            We are hopeful that we should be able to finish the project and deliver the complete AI system to general public in the near future.</p>
        <p class="card-text">8. If users encounter any problems during use or have any other suggestions. Please contact us at
